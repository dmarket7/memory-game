# Memory Game
This was a project completed prior to joining Rithm School. The basic scope is to create a memory gaming using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

# How to play game:
* Click on one card, then click on another card. If it's a match, then card will stay flipped. If not, a match then card will go back to hidden.
* Each click to a different card will add to your score.
* Local storage keeps track of your lowest score.
